Develop a flexible and robust churn prediction system that works across multiple datasets. You
will build a predictive model, create an API for predictions, and incorporate explainability
techniques. The challenge is to create a general solution that handles multiple datasets and
provides insights into how your model makes decisions.
This is not just a typical Kaggle-style exercise; the focus is on building a real-world, scalable
machine learning pipeline that can be deployed and extended for various churn datasets

Churn prediction is a widely-used machine learning problem where the goal is to predict
whether a customer will leave or stop using a product/service. In this assignment, you will
design a system that can handle different customer datasets from various businesses.
